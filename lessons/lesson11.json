          "introduction": "There is no Dholuo equivalent of the verb 'to be'. Thus to say, 'The food is tasty', you would simply say, 'chiemo mit!', which is 'food tasty!'. To get around this, dholuo uses the verb 'tie' which means to be present. This verb is odd in that it takes the full pronouns instead of their derived prefixes (eg. 'antie' instead of 'atie'), and if there's an overt subject, it takes the form 'nitie'. The opposite of 'tie' is 'onge' which means 'to be lacking'.",
