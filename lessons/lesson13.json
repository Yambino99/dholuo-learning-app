This can include the time of day that the child was born, the season of the year, or even the weather at the time of birth. Boys names usually start with 'O' and girls names start with 'A' but its very common to have a boy named after a female relative, in which case their name would start with 'A'. Similarly, girls could be named after a male relative in which case their names would start with 'O'. It is believed that a deceased relative will visit the mother in a dream, and the child will be named after that deceased relative."
